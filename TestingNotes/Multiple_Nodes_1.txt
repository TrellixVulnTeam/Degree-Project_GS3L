Helius - Multiple Nodes Test #1
31/03/2021

Notes
- Tested V4 and V5
- Changed ports  of V5 to test
- to specify angualr port "ng serve --port XXXX"
Port Configs
V4{
	Angular: 4401
	NodeServer: 8000
	Prod_API: 8002
}
V5{
	Angular: 4402
	NodeServer: 8003
	Prod_API: 8004
}
Results
- Firebase postings work
- Prod_API works
- Chain does not work
	- not sure where the issue is. My guess might be soemthing witht the ports and not seeing each other?

The register_with API call in the block chain server is used to add the current node to part of a network.
	Therefore pass it the address (127.0.0.1:port for example) of the EXISTNG node for them to update
	This is intended to be called by a new node to add it to an existing network
